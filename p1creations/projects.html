              <h3 class="snippet__title">Mars Revenge, currently still in development.</h3>
              <p class="snippet__description">Started using Unity game engine for this project. Unity is also cross platform, but it is based on C#. This title is going to be the biggest release yet for P1 Creations, almost done with our android demo. Which we will release as soon as world 3 is fully built and tested.</p>

              <h3 class="snippet__title">Super Mars, also made with libGDX.</h3>
              <p class="snippet__description">It was a lot of fun learning to make a flappy bird clone. Unfortunately with all of the clones already out there I decided not to release this to the public. Yes, I did reuse the same character from Jump, Jump, Mars has made a hit he is going to be used again for current title.</p>

              <h3 class="snippet__title">Jump Jump, another libGDX framework based game.</h3>
              <p class="snippet__description">For my second game this was a great learning experience, and I had a lot of fun drawing the graphics and writting the code. With this game we created our first character, besides a snake, Mars was hit frm the start. That is why we reused him in our games, not just because I'm not a graphic designer.</p>

              <h3 class="snippet__title">Snake Eat, was first game created.</h3>
              <p class="snippet__description">Made with libGDX framework, an awesome cross-platform Java based game development framework, that is open-source. Drawing the 2d graphics for this game was a challenge as I am not an artist persay, but since the assests for this game were only about 32x32 pixels I had a lot of fun creating them.</p>
